AppClipped is a macOS application designed to improve the generation and saving of App Clip Codes. This tool provides a clean and simple interface for working with Apple's App Clip Codes.

This app will soon be released as a free-to-download tool to assist projects using App Clip Codes.

## Limitations

The main limitation of this project is that users must have Apple's `AppClipCodeGenerator` tool downloaded and installed, as this app is a wrapper for that tool.

The process of locating this tool on the user's system is something we aim to improve over time.
